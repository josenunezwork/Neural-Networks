# Neural-Networks
project related to NN training, visuals, learning

Project 1:
Visual of Neural Networks
- See edges update in real time to see how Neural networks work
- color scales depending on weights showing most active neurons based on connections

- Data : currently dummy generated but will use Yfinance downloadeed data later.
- Plan is to visualize different architectures, activitation functions, layer depth ,...etc effects on how weights change.
